# HCA-Dataset-Cleaning

This repository is based on my coursework where the goal was to select a particular issue or "mystery" that data mining could uncover. This project was focused on understanding several aspects of the operations of the hospital that sourced the data:

- Financial profile based on patients served
- Procedures done.
- Demographics of patients
- Correlations between the three

There are four datasets that were used. The cleaned data was then loaded into Tableau for visualization.
